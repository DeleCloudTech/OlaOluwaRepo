Certainly! Here's a simple HTML code for a webpage that says "Welcome to Git class":

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Welcome to Git Class</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
            margin: 50px;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Git Class</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage for learning Git.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code:
- The `<title>` tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- Inside the `<body>` tag, `<h1>` is used for the main heading ("Welcome to Git Class").
- `<p>` is used for a paragraph of text underneath the heading.

You can save this code in a `.html` file and open it with a web browser to see the webpage.
